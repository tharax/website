		<h1>Magic The Gathering vs. The Sharemarket</h1>
		<div class="entries">
                                
                I think the ShareMarket & Magic (The Gathering) have something in common.
                I also think that playing the mood is gambling, where as playing the long game (in the style of warren buffet) is the correct play.
                If you assess 1 company, value a share in the company, and then compare to their current share price, they are either buy/sell. if they are right on the mark
                there is no money to be made in capital gains, but there is some to make in dividends. if it's decent % keep, if its not, sell.</p>
                
                <p>anyways, this was meant to be about a comparrison between magic and share trading.
                I think there are format staples. these are just good companies. monopolies, mostly, or old companies that have been around for awhile.
                i think there are short formats (like standard.) I'd consider one of these to be "social". facebook and twitter. they wont be around in 100 years. i dont think
                they will be around in 20. just like drafting, you can chuck some money into a start up and crank out some decent cash, but you certainly arent meant to hold
                that stock (not for profit anyways) when the block is about to rotate out.
                
                there is also legacy. I wish I had shares in banking companies. they're probably the second oldest profession. there is (almost) a reprint policy - only governments or large sums of 
                money can set one up.
                
                I'd argue there is modern - the digital age. if it's manufacturing or building stuff or its been around for 30-40 years then it's not modern. if it involves comptuers and its recent
                it's modern. see:google, apple, microsoft.</p>
