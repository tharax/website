                <h2>Our 2012 Holiday</h2>
                <p>Note: We've returned from our holiday, but after taking ~2000 photos I have fatigue and don't want to sort them, at least not yet.</p>
                <p>Until I play with adjusting windows, this site is best viewed in a window at least 1820 pixels wide. The first day is friday 7th ,
                and the last day is thursday (10th) (both days I have to be at work). everything is displayed relative to NZ time. (+12 UTC). grey boxes
                are weekends, and green boxes are flights.</p>
                <p>Dubai, Morocco, London, Singapore.</p>
